Final Year Computer Science Project

Automatic Decision Making for The European Court of Human Rights

### Description

<p>Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) is a widely studied and hot topic in Natural Language Processing. It predicts the outcome of a court case based on the text describing the case's facts. The work of Aletras et al. [1] applied it to cases of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases. The court is making the case's documents publicly available. Aletras et al. preliminary work originated a vast literature of NLP approaches centred on this particular dataset [2].</p>

In this project, we plan to focus on the trustworthiness of such approaches by:

. Surveying the literature of LJP for ECHR cases, with a focus on the explainability reliability of such techniques. [PART 1]


. Create an open-source crawler to collect updated data and make them publicly available to boost research in this field. [part 2]


. Replicate existing NLP techniques and evaluate possible ways to improve their trustworthiness. [PART 3]
